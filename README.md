# CSCI-C 311 Elisp Supplement

- This repository simply contains some supplementary files that I created in parallel while working on my CSCI-C 311 Elisp homework assignments (a private repo).  They don't really have any real importance other than to demonstrate a basic understanding of Elisp.

- The [Remove.sh](./Remove.sh) script simply removes backup and temporary files created by Emacs.
