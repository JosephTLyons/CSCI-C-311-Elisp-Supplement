# Lisp / Elisp

- This repository simply contains some supplementary files that I created in parallel while working on my CSCI-C 311 Elisp assignments (a private repo).  They don't really have any real importance other than to demonstrate a simple understanding of Elisp.

- The [Remove.sh](https://github.com/JosephTLyons/CSCI-C-311-Elisp-Supplement/blob/master/Remove.sh) script simply removes backup and temporary files created by Emacs.
